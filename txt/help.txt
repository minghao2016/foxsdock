<ul>
<li><b><font color=blue>Receptor Molecule:</font></b> it is possible to
specify the PDB code of the receptor molecule <b>or</b> upload file in PDB
format. Each code is a four character PDB ID, followed by a colon and
a list of chain IDs, e.g. 2pka:AB. If no chain IDs are given, all the
chains of the PDB file are used.


<li><b><font color=blue>Ligand Molecule:</font></b> same as receptor molecule.

<li><b><font color=blue>SAXS profile: </font></b>
A file with experimental SAXS profile. The experimental file should have 3 columns: q, I(q) and error: <br><br>

#    q  intensity  error  <br>
0.00000 3280247.73 1904.037 <br>
0.00060 3280164.59 1417.031 <br>
0.00120 3279915.19 1840.032 <br>
0.00180 3279499.57 1566.084 <br>

<br>Header lines should be preceded by #. <br>

<br> Please note that: q = (4&pi; sin &theta;) / &lambda;,

<br>
where 2&theta; is the scattering angle and &lambda; is the wavelength of the incident X-ray beam.

If your experimental profile does not contain an error column, the server will add 5% error with Poisson distribution.<br>

Note, lines with zero intensities are skipped. If you profile contains negative intensity values,
FoXS will read in the profile until it encounters the first negative
intensity value. <br>

<li><b><font color=blue>e-mail address:</font></b> the link with the
results of your request is sent to this address. Using this link you
can view the docking results.

<li><b><font color=blue>Complex Type:</font></b> PatchDock has
different sets of parameters, optimized for different types of
complexes. You can always use default complex type. In case of
enzyme-inhibitor complex type, the algorithm restricts the search
space to the cavities of the enzyme molecule. In case of
antibody-antigen complex type, the algorithm automatically detects the
CDRs of the antibody and restricts the search to these regions (note:
the antibody should be specified as 'receptor molecule'). 


<li><b><font color=blue>Weighted SAXS score:</font></b> if checked,
 the server will attempt to account for contributions from the receptor 
and ligand monomers in addition to the complex in the SAXS scoring. This option
is useful for cases when the solution profile is a mixture of the two proteins and their complex.

<a name="dist"></a>
<li><b><font color=blue>Distance constraints:</font></b> The user can
specify distance constraints between pairs of atoms, one in the
receptor and one in the ligand. The distance constraints have to be
given to the server in a text file with the following format:<br>
[receptor_atom_index] [ligand_atom_index] [min_dist] [max_dist] <br>
...<br>
receptor_atom_index and ligand_atom_index are atom indices as
specified in the PDB file (make sure there is only one atom with such
index in your PDB). min_dist is the minimal distance allowed between
the two atoms and max_dist is maximal.<br>
For example:<br>

25 377 0.0 5.0 <br>
340 5603 5.0 10.0 <br>
<br>
this file requires that two distance constraints will be satisfied in
all the docking solutions: atom with index 25 (from receptor) should
be within 5&Aring. from atom with index 377 (from ligand) and atom with
index 340 (from receptor) should be at the distance 5-10&Aring; from atom
with index 5603 (from ligand).

The output of FoXSDock is a list of complex models for user
specified receptor and ligand molecule. The list is presented to the
user in the format of a table; each table line represents one
complex model.

If you didn't receive any output models, this probably means that none of the docking-generated models fits the data well.

<p><b><font color="#000099">Table Format:</font></b><p>
<ul>
<li><b><font color=blue>Model No:</font></b> Number of the model

<li><b><font color=blue>Z-Score:</font></b> The z-score that combines interface energy and fit to the SAXS profile [1]. The models are
sorted according to this score.

<li><b><font color=blue>SAXS &chi; score:</font></b> &chi; score of the fit to SAXS profile for the model as calculated by FoXS [1-2].

<li><b><font color=blue>Energy score:</font></b> Energy score as calculated by <a href="https://salilab.org/SOAP"> SOAP-PP </a> statistical potential [3].


<li><b><font color=blue>Transformation: </font></b> 3D transformation:
3 rotational angles and 3 translational parameters. The transformation
should be applied on the ligand molecule.

<li><b><font color=blue>PDB file of the complex:</font></b> The
predicted complex structure in PDB format.
